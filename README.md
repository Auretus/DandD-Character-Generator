## Description

Starfinder Starter is an application that is meant for players of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game.

It is a combination of a quick-reference guide of the Playerâ€™s Handbook and a character creator that stores multiple characters on the app.

RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Starfinder are all games that historically take a long time to get going. The most tedious part is getting all the characters together and the campaign rolling.

Starfinder Starter is here to make that process easy and painless, to get the game finally started!
